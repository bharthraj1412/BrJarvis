## 2. Critical Bugs & Crash Issues

### 🔴 BUG-001: Startup Crash — `self.ui` AttributeError

**Status**: ACTIVE (visible in terminal output)

```
self.ui.on_text_command = self._on_text_command
    ^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'BRVoiceAssistant' object has no attribute 'ui'
```

**Root Cause**: In the recent voice fix, `self.ui = ui` was accidentally removed from `BRVoiceAssistant.__init__()`. The `__init__` sets `self.orchestrator`, `self.backends`, etc., but skips `self.ui = ui`.

**Fix**: Add `self.ui = ui` back as the first line after `def __init__(self, ui: JarvisUI):`.

---

### 🔴 BUG-002: `asyncio.get_event_loop()` Deprecation Crash on Python 3.14

Python 3.14 removes the implicit event loop creation in `get_event_loop()`. This will raise `DeprecationWarning` now and `RuntimeError` in future versions.

**Fix**: Use `asyncio.get_running_loop()` inside async context.

---

### 🔴 BUG-003: Orchestrator ReAct Loop Can Infinite-Loop

If a tool consistently returns non-terminal output that triggers another tool call, the loop runs 20 iterations burning tokens. There is **no backoff or dedup detection** — the same tool can be called with identical args 20 times.

**Fix**: Add tool call deduplication: if the same `(tool, args)` pair is called twice in a row, break with an error.

---

### 🔴 BUG-004: `_run_async` Deadlock in Tool Registry

```python
# tools/registry.py:66-69
if loop is not None and loop.is_running():
    future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
    return future.result(timeout=30)
```

If a tool calls another async tool from within the event loop thread, `run_coroutine_threadsafe` + `.result()` creates a deadlock — the loop can't process the future because the thread is blocked waiting for it.

---

### 🔴 BUG-005: Memory SQLite Concurrent Access Corruption

`persistent_store.py`, `conversation_store.py`, and `session_store.py` all open independent SQLite connections. Concurrent writes from multiple threads (voice thread + server thread + task queue thread) can cause `database is locked` errors.

---

### 🟠 BUG-006: Server WebSocket Broadcast Blocks Event Loop

Every `print()` in the application goes through `WSBroadcastStream`, which attempts to broadcast to all WebSocket clients synchronously. If any WebSocket client is slow or disconnected, this blocks stdout for the entire process.

---

### 🟠 BUG-007: Tool Registry Import Storm

On first tool call, `_import_plugins()` eagerly imports all 34 tool modules and all action modules. Each import triggers its own cascade of imports (playwright, opencv, chromadb, etc.). This causes a 5-15 second stall on the first command.

---

### 🟠 BUG-008: `ui.py` is 72KB / 2000+ Lines — Unmaintainable Monolith

The entire Tkinter HUD — animations, API key dialog, chat log, voice state, settings panels, face rendering, waveform visualization — is in a single 72KB file. Any change risks breaking unrelated features.

---

### 🟠 BUG-009: Hardcoded API Key in Gemini Backend

```python
# backends/gemini.py:69
api_key_val = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "sk-5ec70bf9fa324084b7a7326babf52c45").strip()
```

A hardcoded API key fallback is embedded in source code. Even if it's a local proxy key, this is a secret that should never be in version control.

---

### 🟠 BUG-010: Agent Executor Tool Name Aliasing is Fragile

The executor has a hardcoded mapping of 15+ tool name aliases. When new tools are added, this mapping is never updated, causing the planner to generate tool names the executor can't resolve.

---

## 3. Security Vulnerabilities

### 🔴 SEC-001: Permission System Allows Everything by Default

```python
ALWAYS_ALLOWED: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "run_code", "nmap_scan", "file_read", "browser_control", ...
})
```

`run_code` and `nmap_scan` are in `ALWAYS_ALLOWED`. Combined with the default `ALLOW_ALL` mode, any LLM hallucination or prompt injection can execute arbitrary Python code or network scans without user confirmation.

---

### 🔴 SEC-002: Code Execution Tool Has No Sandbox

The `run_code` tool executes arbitrary Python via `exec()` or `subprocess` with no sandboxing, no filesystem restrictions, and no network restrictions. A malicious prompt can run destructive commands.

---

### 🔴 SEC-003: Guardian Integrity Check is Self-Referential

The Guardian hashes its own files, but if an attacker modifies `guardian/core.py` to remove itself from `PROTECTED_CORE_PATHS`, the integrity check passes. The hash baseline is stored in memory (not on disk or a secure enclave), so it's reset on every restart.

---

### 🟠 SEC-004: API Keys Stored in Plain JSON

API keys are stored in a plain JSON file with no encryption, no file permission restrictions, and the file is potentially committed to git.

---

### 🟠 SEC-005: Web Dashboard Has No Authentication

The FastAPI server exposes `/chat`, `/ws`, `/api/system`, and tool execution endpoints with zero authentication. Any process on localhost (or any network peer if bound to `0.0.0.0`) can send commands to JARVIS.

---

### 🟠 SEC-006: Prompt Injection Via Voice Input

All spoken text is injected directly into LLM prompts without sanitization. A nearby speaker or video could speak adversarial instructions and they would be processed.

---

## 4. Performance & Scalability Issues

### ⚡ PERF-001: Context Window Waste — Full Tool Schema on Every Call

Even with pruning, the tool prompt block serializes 50+ tool schemas (~3000 tokens) into every single LLM call. For a 20-step ReAct loop, that's 60,000 tokens wasted on tool definitions alone.

**Fix**: Only include tools relevant to the current step based on intent classification.

---

### ⚡ PERF-002: Vector Memory Search on Every Message

Every user message triggers a vector similarity search (~50-200ms per query). For simple commands like "open chrome", this latency is pure waste.

---

### ⚡ PERF-003: No Connection Pooling for AI Backends

Each backend creates a new HTTP client. There's no connection reuse, no keep-alive, and no request batching.

---

### ⚡ PERF-004: WorkingMemory Stores Full Response Text

The working memory accumulates full LLM responses (including tool call blocks) up to 120K tokens. This is re-injected into every subsequent LLM call, causing exponential token growth.

---

### ⚡ PERF-005: Tkinter UI Runs at 25fps Even When Idle

Multiple animation timers fire every 40ms (25fps) for orb pulsing, waveform visualization, and state transitions — even when the window is minimized or no speech activity is occurring.

---

## 5. Architectural Debt & Code Quality

### 🏗️ ARCH-001: No Dependency Injection — Global Singletons Everywhere

17+ modules use global mutable singletons with no lifecycle management. Testing requires monkey-patching globals.

---

### 🏗️ ARCH-002: Circular Import Chains

`orchestrator.py` → `tools/registry.py` → `tools/*.py` → `actions/*.py` → `orchestrator.py` (via `set_orchestrator_ref`). This creates fragile import ordering that breaks with any refactor.

---

### 🏗️ ARCH-003: Duplicated Entry Points

There are **4 separate entry points** that initialize the same backend stack independently: `start.py`, `main.py`, `server.py`, `floating_voice_ui.py`. Each has its own UTF-8 fix, dotenv loading, path setup, and error handling — all duplicated.

---

### 🏗️ ARCH-004: No Type Safety — `dict` Everywhere

Tool parameters, memory entries, and agent results are all passed as untyped `dict` objects. There are Pydantic models in some places but raw dicts in the core pipeline.

---

### 🏗️ ARCH-005: 11 Duplicate Excel/XLSX Analysis Files in Project Root

Generated artifacts cluttering the project root. They should be in a `reports/` directory or `.gitignore`d.

---

### 🏗️ ARCH-006: Dead Code Modules

| Module | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| `tts_queue.py` | Complete priority queue system — never instantiated anywhere |
| `audio_processor.py` | AudioProcessor instantiated but methods never called |
| `anthropic_backend.py` (root) | 198-byte stub that just imports from `backends/` — redundant |
| `gemini_backend.py` (root) | Same — root-level stub, dead |
| `openai_backend.py` (root) | Same pattern |
| `mistral_backend.py` (root) | Same pattern |
| `nvidia_backend.py` (root) | Same pattern |
| `ollama_backend.py` (root) | Same pattern |
| `main_mk37.py` | 22KB legacy file superseded by current architecture |

---

### 🏗️ ARCH-007: No Structured Logging

Every module uses `print()` with ad-hoc prefixes: `[JARVIS]`, `[Voice]`, `[GeminiLive]`, `[WhisperLocal]`, `[Executor]`, `[Guardian]`. There's a `core/logging.py` file but most modules don't use it.

---

## 6. Module-by-Module Issues

### `orchestrator.py` — ReAct Brain

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🔴 | No tool-call deduplication — same tool can be called 20x with identical args |
| 2 | 🔴 | `_recall_context` runs vector search on trivial commands like "hi" |
| 3 | 🟠 | `_extract_keywords` uses naive string matching — misclassifies intents |
| 4 | 🟠 | Mode system (`/mode recon`) is undiscoverable — no help text or autocomplete |
| 5 | 🟡 | `_save_turn` truncates responses to 500 chars — loses important context |

### `router.py` — Backend Router

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🟠 | Health check caches stale results — a crashed backend stays "healthy" for minutes |
| 2 | 🟠 | Routing rules are hardcoded — no way to customize per-user preferences |
| 3 | 🟡 | `DeepSeek` backend listed but no routing rule references it |

### `agent/executor.py` — Task Executor

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🔴 | Tool alias map (15+ entries) will silently break when new tools are added |
| 2 | 🟠 | Thread pool has no size limit — 100 parallel goals = 100 threads |
| 3 | 🟠 | No timeout on individual tool execution — a hung tool blocks forever |
| 4 | 🟡 | `StepResult` collects results in memory with no eviction |

### `agent/planner.py` — Task Planner

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🟠 | Plans are generated as free-text — parsing depends on brittle regex |
| 2 | 🟡 | No plan caching — identical goals re-plan from scratch |

### `tools/registry.py` — Tool Registry

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🔴 | `_run_async` can deadlock when called from within event loop thread |
| 2 | 🟠 | `_import_plugins()` eagerly imports all 34 modules on first use |
| 3 | 🟡 | Tool schema JSON serialized to string on every LLM call — should be cached |

### `backends/gemini.py` — Primary Backend

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🔴 | Hardcoded API key fallback in source code |
| 2 | 🟠 | `FALLBACK_MODELS` list includes preview/experimental models that may be removed |
| 3 | 🟠 | No exponential backoff on rate limit errors |
| 4 | 🟡 | Streaming response collects full text in memory before returning |

### `memory/` — Memory System (16 files)

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🔴 | SQLite concurrent writes from multiple threads — `database is locked` |
| 2 | 🟠 | `persistent_store.py` writes markdown files with no file locking |
| 3 | 🟠 | `vector_store.py` ChromaDB collection created on every startup |
| 4 | 🟠 | No memory size limits — vector store grows unbounded |
| 5 | 🟡 | `consolidator.py` runs LLM calls to summarize memories — burns tokens |
| 6 | 🟡 | `memory_scan.py` scans for stale memories but doesn't auto-clean |

### `guardian/` — Safety System

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🔴 | Integrity hashes stored in memory — reset on every restart |
| 2 | 🟠 | `kill_switch.py` pause state is also in-memory — restart bypasses it |
| 3 | 🟠 | `rollback.py` snapshots use `shutil.copytree` — slow for large directories |
| 4 | 🟡 | `audit_log.py` writes JSON lines to file — no log rotation |

### `vision/` — Computer Vision

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🟠 | `ocr_engine.py` falls back to Tesseract OCR which has poor accuracy |
| 2 | 🟠 | `screen_analyst.py` captures full screen — no region-of-interest support |
| 3 | 🟡 | `accessibility.py` uses `pywinauto` which is Windows-only |
| 4 | 🟡 | `dom_bridge.py` stub — browser DOM extraction not implemented |

### `workflow/` — DAG Scheduler

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🟠 | No cycle detection in DAG — circular dependencies cause infinite loop |
| 2 | 🟡 | Scheduler has no persistence — running workflows lost on crash |

### `evolution/` — Self-Upgrade System

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🟠 | `sandbox.py` runs upgrade code in-process — no true isolation |
| 2 | 🟠 | `deployer.py` applies changes directly to live codebase — no staging |
| 3 | 🟡 | `classifier.py` classifies changes as safe/unsafe using keyword matching |

### `web/` — PWA Dashboard

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🟠 | No authentication — anyone on the network can control JARVIS |
| 2 | 🟠 | WebSocket reconnection logic absent — dropped connections are permanent |
| 3 | 🟡 | `app.js` is 19KB monolith — should be modularized |
| 4 | 🟡 | No responsive design for mobile browsers |

### `native/` — C Native Bridge

| # | Severity | Issue |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | 🟡 | `jarvis_native.c` compiled on startup — fails silently if compiler not installed |
| 2 | 🟡 | Linux `.so` file committed to git — platform-specific binary in repo |

---

## 7. Upgrade Recommendations

### 🔧 UPG-001: Migrate to Structured Tool Calling (Gemini Function Calling)

**Current**: Tools are defined as text schemas injected into the system prompt. The LLM outputs ` ```tool_call {...} ``` ` blocks which are parsed with regex.

**Upgrade**: Use Gemini's native function calling API. Define tools as `FunctionDeclaration` objects. The model returns structured `function_call` objects — no regex parsing, fewer hallucinated tool names, and ~40% fewer tokens.

---

### 🔧 UPG-002: Replace Tkinter UI with Web-Only Dashboard

**Current**: 72KB Tkinter monolith (`ui.py`) + separate web dashboard + floating overlay = 3 UI codebases.

**Upgrade**: Retire Tkinter entirely. Use the FastAPI server as the single frontend, with Electron or Tauri for desktop integration. Benefits: single UI codebase, cross-platform, modern web technologies.

---

### 🔧 UPG-003: Implement Proper Async Architecture

**Current**: Blocking `orchestrator.chat()` wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()`. Mixed sync/async throughout.

**Upgrade**: Make the orchestrator fully async. Use `async def chat()` with `await` for backend calls, tool execution, and memory queries. This eliminates thread pool exhaustion and deadlocks.

---

### 🔧 UPG-004: Add Structured Logging with `structlog`

**Current**: 100+ `print()` statements with inconsistent prefixes.

**Upgrade**: Replace all `print()` with `structlog` structured logging. Benefits: log levels, JSON output for aggregation, correlation IDs for request tracing, configurable output.

---

### 🔧 UPG-005: Database Migration — SQLite with WAL + Connection Pool

**Current**: Raw `sqlite3.connect()` in 3+ modules with no pooling.

**Upgrade**: Use `aiosqlite` with a connection pool or migrate to a single `sqlite3` connection with WAL mode and `check_same_thread=False`.

---

### 🔧 UPG-006: Implement Tool Call Result Caching

**Current**: Every tool call executes from scratch, even if the same query was run seconds ago.

**Upgrade**: Add an LRU cache for deterministic tools (web_search, file_read, system_diagnostic). Cache key = `(tool_name, frozen_args)`, TTL = 60s. Can eliminate 30-50% of redundant tool calls.

---

### 🔧 UPG-007: Add Rate Limiting and Cost Tracking

**Current**: No visibility into token usage or API costs. A runaway ReAct loop can burn through credits rapidly.

**Upgrade**: Add per-session and per-day token counters. Log cost estimates based on model pricing. Add configurable limits.

---

### 🔧 UPG-008: Upgrade Backend Model List

**Current**: Gemini fallback list includes `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-1.5-pro`.

**Upgrade**: Prioritize latest models: `gemini-3.5-flash` → `gemini-3.1-pro` → `gemini-2.5-flash`. Remove deprecated models. Add `gemini-3.5-pro` when available.

---

### 🔧 UPG-009: Unify Entry Points into Single CLI

**Current**: 4 separate entry points (`start.py`, `main.py`, `server.py`, `floating_voice_ui.py`).

**Upgrade**: Single CLI entry point:
```bash
jarvis              # Default: TUI mode
jarvis --voice      # Voice HUD mode
jarvis --server     # Web dashboard mode
jarvis --overlay    # Floating overlay mode
jarvis --headless   # API-only mode
```

---

### 🔧 UPG-010: Add Plugin Marketplace / Community Skills

**Current**: Skills are bundled in the `skills/` directory with no install/update mechanism.

**Upgrade**: Add a skill registry with `jarvis install skill-name` support. Skills can be loaded from GitHub repos, local directories, or a central registry.

## 8. New Feature Ideas

### 💡 IDEA-001: Autonomous Background Agent
A persistent background agent that monitors system state and proactively takes action — e.g., "Your disk is 90% full, I cleaned 2GB of temp files" or "Your meeting starts in 5 minutes, here's the agenda."

### 💡 IDEA-002: Multi-Modal Live Screen Understanding
Continuously capture the screen at 1fps, feed frames to Gemini Vision, and maintain a "screen context" that the assistant can reference. User says "what's on my screen?" → instant answer.

### 💡 IDEA-003: Conversation Memory Graph
Replace flat vector memory with a knowledge graph. Store entities, relationships, and facts as nodes/edges. Enable queries like "What did I decide about the database migration last week?"

### 💡 IDEA-004: Local LLM Fallback (Ollama Auto-Switch)
When internet is unavailable, automatically switch to a local Ollama model. Seamless degradation — user doesn't notice the switch except for slightly slower responses.

### 💡 IDEA-005: Voice Cloning / Custom Voice
Allow users to clone their own voice or select from a library of voices for TTS output. Integrate with ElevenLabs or Coqui TTS.

### 💡 IDEA-006: Task History Timeline & Replay
A visual timeline showing everything JARVIS did: files created, commands run, APIs called, decisions made. Users can "replay" past sessions step-by-step.

### 💡 IDEA-007: Smart Notification System
JARVIS monitors email, calendar, news, and system events. Delivers relevant notifications via voice or desktop toast.

### 💡 IDEA-008: Collaborative Multi-User Mode
Multiple users can connect to the same JARVIS instance via the web dashboard. Each user has their own memory, preferences, and permission level.

### 💡 IDEA-009: Code Project Intelligence
JARVIS can deeply understand an entire codebase. Point it at a repo and ask "How does the authentication flow work?" It indexes the code, builds a semantic map, and answers architectural questions.

### 💡 IDEA-010: AR/Smart Glasses Integration
Send JARVIS's voice output and visual overlays to AR glasses. Users get a heads-up display showing current task status, notifications, and real-time information.

### 💡 IDEA-011: Emotional Intelligence / Sentiment Awareness
JARVIS detects user frustration, excitement, or confusion from voice tone and word choice. Adapts its response style accordingly.

### 💡 IDEA-012: File Watcher / Project Monitor
Watch a project directory and automatically react to changes: "Your build failed — I found the error on line 47 and here's a fix."

### 💡 IDEA-013: Smart Home Integration (IoT Bridge)
Control smart home devices via voice: "Turn off the living room lights." Bridge to Home Assistant, Google Home, or Alexa.

### 💡 IDEA-014: Automated Daily Briefing
Every morning, JARVIS generates a personalized briefing: weather, calendar, news highlights, stock portfolio, pending tasks, system health.

### 💡 IDEA-015: Plugin SDK with Hot-Reload
A proper SDK for third-party developers to create JARVIS plugins. Plugins can register tools, add UI panels, hook into events, and are hot-reloaded without restart.
